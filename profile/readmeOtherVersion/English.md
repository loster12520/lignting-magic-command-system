### what is it?

This is a system that uses plain text instructions to load packaged plug-ins

Probably using instructions like the following, you can call the corresponding function in the system

```
print HelloWorld
```

Here is a message output to the system: "HelloWorld"

(Unfortunately, this interesting feature is not implemented yet, and will probably only appear as eggs in the future)

Of course, the actual application scenario is not like this

The client sends a message to the server, which, unsurprisingly, is the instruction described above

The server then searches for compliance with the instructions defined by the loaded plug-in

The instructions are then executed and the result is finally sent to the client
